# Responsive_Portfolio
I had fun with this assignment, however, there were a few issues that I was unable to resolve. 

1) The toggle button in the navigation bar - once I place the screen in responsive (mobile) mode, the menu disappears except for the button. I was unable to activate the toggle that appears to the right to dropdown and show the other menu options. I believe that this may require some Javascript and I just am not fluent enough in the language. I tried a few different tactics but to no avail. 
    I would love to know how to fix this issue!!!
    

2) I was unable to center the navigation bar or change the font color. This may be due to bootstrap coding that inhibits the possiblity. 

3) I removed the footer from the 'Contact' page as it covered the 'Submit' button. I tried to clear the footer, but it did not work and still covered the Submit button. Any recommendations on this?!?!
